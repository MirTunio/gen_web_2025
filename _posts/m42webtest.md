## Background

Mach 42 is a research-driven trading technology firm, founded in 2019 to tackle the lack of automated trading infrastructure at the PSX. We specialize in developing quantitative trading strategies, and developing the trading systems to support them.

## What We Do

We are a dedicated team of quantitative researchers, engineers and traders with a keen interest in financial engineering. Combining our data analytics with market microstructure expertise, we are developing a fine-grained understanding of trade execution in emerging and developing markets.

Emerging and developing markets present a unique set of challenges of quantitative traders, to name a few: illiquidity shocks, low market volumes, limited derivative instruments, and dated infrastructure. Our approach is designed to operate effectively within constraints.

We are currently optimizing strategies designed to:

- **Enhance market liquidity** through optimized slicing and timing of orders, executing large volume trades efficiently while minimizing market impact.
- **Provide execution solutions** that help optimize execution during periods of insufficient liquidity and excess volatility.
- **Simplify market-making** for designated liquidity providers, enabling tighter spreads, better quotes, while optimizing capital efficiency and inventory management.

The next phase for Mach 42 involves refining and validating our algorithms, stress-testing our systems in live market conditions, creating strategic partnerships and obtaining the necessary licensing to expand our capabilities. In the future, alongside trading our proprietary strategies, we aim to offer order execution services and serve as major liquidity provider in the markets we operate in. 

Through research, iteration, and responsible deployment we ensure that our systems and strategies are not only profitable but also contribute positively to the full spectrum of market participants, from institutions to retail investors.
